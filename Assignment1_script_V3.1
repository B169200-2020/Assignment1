##### First step is to create a directory for the output file.
##### User is asked to input the path, this will be used to create a subdirectory for all subsequent output files.
##### The Subdirectory is stored as a variable.

inputpath () {
echo -e "Input the path of an already existing directory, followed by the name you would like to give your (output) subdirectory (don't include the / at the end of the path). This subdirectory will be the home of all of your subsequent output data."

##### This will read the path inputted by the user and save it as a variable called outputsubdirectory

read outputsubdirectory
echo -e "\n"
read -p "Please confirm that "$outputsubdirectory" is the subdirectory that you wish to create (y/n)" choice
if [ "$choice" = "y" ];
then 

##### This will create the subdirectory which will be where all the subsequent output files will be saved.

mkdir "${outputsubdirectory}"
echo -e "\nYour output subdirectory has been created, its path has been provided below."
echo -e "${outputsubdirectory}"

else 
##### This will return the user to the start if he/she enters the wrong path.
inputpath;
fi
}



inputpath



##### Next is obtain all of the raw data from the directory in which it is stored!!
##### The user will be asked for the path to the directory containing all of the raw data, this will be saved as a variable
##### All the files ending with fq.gz will then be copied into a subdirectory: outputsubdirectory/RAWDATA.

Obtainingrawdata () {
echo -e "\n Input the path of the directory containing all of the raw data (do not include / at the end of the path)"


##### The raw data path supplied by the user is then read and saved as a variable called rawdatapath

read rawdatapath
echo -e "\n"

##### We now want to find all of the desired raw data files!
##### This finds all of the files ending with fq.gz
##### These files are then sorted, counted and displayed in a column for the user to see if there is the expected number of raw data files.

find ${rawdatapath} -name '*.fq.gz' | sort | nl | column -t
echo -e "\n"
read -p "Are these files the desired raw data files? (y/n)" choice
if [ "$choice" = "y" ];
then
echo -e "\n"
rawdatafiles=$(find ${rawdatapath} -name '*.fq.gz')
##### We now want to create a subdirectory for the raw data!, the parent directory of this subdirectory is the outputsubdirectory created earlier.
##### once the raw data subdirectory is created, we then want to copy all of the raw data files there!

mkdir ${outputsubdirectory}/RAWDATA
cp -r ${rawdatafiles} ${outputsubdirectory}/RAWDATA
echo -e "Rawdata files have been copied to: ${outputsubdirectory}/RAWDATA \n"
#####
#####

else
echo -e "\nUnable to locate the provided path, please try again\n"
Obtainingrawdata;
fi
}


Obtainingrawdata 


##### So now we have created a directory for all of the raw data files and copied these raw data files into that Directory!
##### How ever we also need to obtain the file which contains all of the sample details!!


Obtainingsampledetails () {
echo -e "\nInput the name of the file in which the sample details are stored, for example: fqfiles"
##### The user input is read and saved as a variable called "sampledetailfile"
read sampledetailfile
echo "\n"

##### The script needs to locate the sample details file.
##### The script then need to print the name of the lifecycles
##### and then print the names of the forwards and reverse sequence files

 
find ${rawdatapath} -type f -name ${sampledetailfile} | xargs -I {} cat {} | awk '{print $2, $3, $NF;}' | column -t | nl
echo "\n"
read -p "Are these your desired sample details? (y/n)" choice2
if [ "$choice2" = "y" ];
	then 
	echo -e "\n"
##### If the user is happy with the these sample files and selects "y", then the script will go on to find the sample detail file using the rawdatapath which was provided by the user earlier on.
##### Once the script has found the sample detail files using the rawdatapath, the script will save it as a variable (called samplefile)
	samplefile=$(find ${rawdatapath} -type f -name ${sampledetailfile})
##### Once the sample detail files have been found and saved as a variable, they are the copied to the RAWDATA subdirectory.
	cp ${samplefile} ${outputsubdirectory}/RAWDATA
	echo -e "The fqfiles containing the sample details have been copied to: ${outputsubdirectory}/RAWDATA \n"
	else
	echo -e"\nThe provided path to the sample detail files has not been recognised, please try again. \n"
Obtainingsampledetails;
fi
